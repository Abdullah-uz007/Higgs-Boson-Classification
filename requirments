## 📌 Project Requirements / Goals

This project was part of **Deep Learning | DS & AI Cohort 13**. The objective was to **design, train, and evaluate a deep learning model using tabular data**, applying learned techniques in model architecture, optimization, and regularization to solve a real-world binary classification task.

### Dataset
- **Type:** Tabular — Higgs Boson Signal Classification  
- **Source:** [Kaggle Higgs Boson Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/higgs-boson)  
- **Task:** Predict whether a particle collision event corresponds to a Higgs boson signal or background noise  
- **Features:** 30 anonymized real-valued features derived from particle physics measurements  

### Tasks to Perform
1. **Data Preparation**
   - Normalize continuous features  
   - Handle any missing or zero-filled values  
   - Split dataset into **train/validation/test** (e.g., 70/15/15)  

2. **Model Building**
   - Define architecture:
     - Hidden layers, units, activation functions  
     - Output layer with **sigmoid activation**  
     - Loss function: **binary crossentropy**  
   - Set **optimizer, learning rate, and epochs**  
   - Apply regularization techniques (**Dropout, BatchNorm**)  
   - Use callbacks: **EarlyStopping, ReduceLROnPlateau**  
   - Experiment with deeper architectures or alternative optimizers (**RMSprop, AdamW**)  

3. **Model Evaluation**
   - Plot training & validation **accuracy/loss curves**  
   - Report performance using:
     - Accuracy  
     - Precision, Recall, F1-Score  
     - Confusion Matrix and ROC-AUC curve  
   - Compare performance with a **tree-based baseline** (e.g., XGBoost)  

4. **Reflection**
   - Answer questions in the notebook:
     - How did model depth and activation affect performance?  
     - What helped mitigate overfitting?  
     - How did learning rate and optimizer affect convergence?  
     - What would you improve with more time or compute?
